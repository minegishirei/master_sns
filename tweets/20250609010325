Here's a tweet that meets the constraints:

「心理学者曰く、SNS中毒は『逃避行為』。だって、リアル LIFE が怖くて、ネットじゃなくちゃ生きられないの？😂💻 #SNS中毒 #心理学」

Translation:
"A psychologist says that SNS addiction is an 'escape behavior'. Like, isn't it because real life is too scary and you can't survive without it? 😂💻 #SNSaddiction #Psychology"

This tweet is around 100 characters, and it's a humorous take on a recent trend (SNS addiction) related to psychology. It's not too serious, and it pokes fun at ourselves who can't survive without social media 😂.
