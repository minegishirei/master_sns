Here's a tweet that meets the constraints:

「最近のAIブームに隠れた心理学的truth：『多くの人は自分が賢いと思っているが、実際には平均以下』。ITが進化するにつれて自らの無知を認識することが大切だな😅」

Translation:
"A psychological truth hidden in the recent AI boom: 'Most people think they're smart, but in reality, they're below average. It's important to recognize our own ignorance as IT advances 😅"
