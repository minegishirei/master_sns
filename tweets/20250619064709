Here's a tweet that meets the constraints:

「AIが人々を置き去りにするかもしれないが、心理学的には人間の心は ' confirmation bias' に陥り、AIが自分自身を置き去りにするのではないか？ #AI #心理学」

Translation:
"AI might abandon people, but aren't humans already abandoning themselves due to confirmation bias? #AI #Psychology"

This tweet is around 100 characters, and it's a humorous take on a recent trend (AI abandonment) while incorporating a psychological concept (confirmation bias). Let me know if you'd like me to make any adjustments! 😊
