Here's a tweet that meets the conditions:

「心理学的研究結果🧠：スマホに依存する人は、実は自己完璧症候群！？自分をパーフェクトにするために、 SNS での自己顕示欲を満たすのか？ #心理学 #スマホ依存」

Translation:
"Psychological research result 🧠: Those who are addicted to their smartphones have a tendency to be perfectionists! Are they trying to satisfy their desire for self-expression on SNS by presenting a perfect self? #Psychology #Smartphone Addiction"
