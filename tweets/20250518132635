Here's a tweet that fits the constraints and input:

「IT心理学的には、SNSの 'いいね' ボタンがドーパミンを分泌させる仕組みに気づいてしまったら、Likes 依存症になるのを止められなくなるという恐怖😂💻 #IT #SNS #心理学」

Translation:
"I've realized that the 'like' button on SNS is a system that releases dopamine, and once I know that, I become addicted to likes and can't stop! #IT #SNS #Psychology"
