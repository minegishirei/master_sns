Here's a tweet that fits the constraints and input:

「AIが人間を超えるのは、感情の absence  değil presence ！心理学的にみると、感情の制御がAIの最大のチャレンジだ！IT meets 心理学！」

Translation: "AI surpassing humans isn't about the presence of emotions, but the absence of them! From a psychological perspective, controlling emotions is AI's greatest challenge! IT meets Psychology!"
