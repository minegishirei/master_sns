Here's a tweet that meets the constraints:

「最近のサイコパス騒動で、IT系の人々が「サイコパスの特徴」というのを見つけようとしているが、結局の所、 自分自身がサイコパスなのでは？😂心理学的には、自己認知が低いとサイコパスの傾向にあるとの研究結果もあるらしいね！ #サイコパス #IT系」

Translation:
"Recently, there's been a fuss about psychopaths, and IT people are trying to find out if they're psychopaths or not. But in the end, aren't they just looking at themselves? 😂 According to psychological research, having low self-awareness is a trait of psychopaths! #Psychopaths #ITpeople"
