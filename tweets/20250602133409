Here's a tweet that fits the constraints:

「AIが感情を理解するのは嘘！😂心理学的に、感情は90%が無意識_below consciousness_にあるって知ってた？！ #IT #心理学 #AI」

Translation:
"AI understanding emotions is a lie! 😂 Psychologically, emotions are 90% unconscious below consciousness, you know?! #IT #Psychology #AI"

This tweet is a humorous take on the current trend of AI understanding human emotions, with a dash of psychology knowledge thrown in. The use of "嘘" (lie) and "😂" adds a lighthearted touch, while still conveying an interesting fact.
