Here's a tweet that meets the constraints:

「😂心理学的事実：SNSで自分を高く売り込む人の脳内には、'自己Enhancement Bias'（自己高揚バイアス）が働いている！自分が書いた文章を自分自身で高く評価する傾向にあるらしい！ ITでは、AIがこんなバイアスをなくすための技術を開発してる！ 🤖 #ITトレンド」

Translation:
"A psychological fact: people who highly praise themselves on SNS have a 'self-enhancement bias' in their brain! It seems that they tend to highly evaluate the articles they wrote! In IT, AI is developing technology to eliminate such biases! 🤖 #ITtrend"
